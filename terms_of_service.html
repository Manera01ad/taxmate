    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last updated: March 2026</p>
    <p>By using the TaxMate service, you agree to the following terms and conditions:</p>

    <h2>1. General Service</h2>
    <p>TaxMate provides automated tax filing services based on user-provided data. While we strive for accuracy, users
        are responsible for the correctness of the information they provide via WhatsApp.</p>

    <h2>2. Tax Liability</h2>
    <p>TaxMate is NOT a certified Chartered Accountant firm. Our service is based on standard Indian tax laws and
        algorithms for simplified cases. For complex tax situations, we recommend seeking professional consultation.</p>

    <h2>3. Accuracy</h2>
    <p>Tax estimates provided by the bot are based on the latest available tax slabs (FY 2024-25). Final tax liability
        may vary slightly depending on individual conditions and government updates.</p>

    <h2>4. Liability Limitation</h2>
    <p>TaxMate is not liable for any penalties or interest charged by the Income Tax Department due to incorrect data
        provided by the user or delays in processing.</p>
